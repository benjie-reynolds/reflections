When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is beneficial for allowing others to collaborate on your project,
as well as being able to access your files from anywhere on any device. It also can
serve as a backup.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If you're working on something new locally, the automatic pulls from the remote repo
could cause some unwanted loss of your work. Keeping things manual keeps the user
in control of the data.
